# GitHub Push Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Summary
When attempting to push the Origo.Licensing module to GitHub, encountered the error:
```
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/haffimt/Origo.Licensing.git/' not found
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **authentication problems** rather than repository existence issues. Multiple factors contributed:

1. **Wrong GitHub Account Active**: The GitHub CLI was authenticated with `ori-hmt` instead of the target account `haffimt`
2. **Cached Credentials**: Windows Credential Manager had cached incorrect GitHub credentials
3. **Repository Didn't Exist**: The target repository `haffimt/Origo.Licensing` hadn't been created yet

## Diagnostic Steps Performed

### 1. Repository Verification
```powershell
git remote -v
# Confirmed remote was correctly set to: https://github.com/haffimt/Origo.Licensing.git
```
**Rationale**: Verify the remote URL was correct and matched the intended repository.

### 2. GitHub CLI Authentication Check
```powershell
gh auth status
```
**Result**: Revealed that `ori-hmt` was the active account instead of `haffimt`.
**Rationale**: GitHub CLI authentication determines which account is used for repository operations.

### 3. GitHub Account Switch
```powershell
gh auth switch --user haffimt
```
**Result**: Successfully switched to the correct GitHub account.
**Rationale**: Ensures all GitHub operations use the intended account credentials.

### 4. Repository Creation
```powershell
gh repo create haffimt/Origo.Licensing --public
```
**Result**: Successfully created the repository under the correct account.
**Rationale**: The repository must exist before pushing code to it.

### 5. Credential Cache Cleanup
```powershell
cmdkey /delete:git:https://github.com
```
**Result**: Cleared cached Windows credentials for GitHub.
**Rationale**: Cached credentials from the wrong account were preventing proper authentication.

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: GitHub Account Management
- **Action**: Used `gh auth switch --user haffimt` to switch to correct account
- **Why**: Multiple GitHub accounts can cause authentication conflicts
- **Prevention**: Always verify active account with `gh auth status` before operations

### Solution 2: Repository Creation
- **Action**: Created repository using `gh repo create haffimt/Origo.Licensing --public`
- **Why**: Repository must exist before pushing code
- **Prevention**: Create repositories first, or use GitHub web interface

### Solution 3: Credential Management
- **Action**: Cleared Windows Credential Manager cache with `cmdkey /delete:git:https://github.com`
- **Why**: Cached credentials from wrong account blocked proper authentication
- **Prevention**: Regular credential cleanup when working with multiple accounts

## Final Verification Steps

### 1. Successful Push
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```
**Result**: 
```
Enumerating objects: 11, done.
Counting objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Delta compression using up to 24 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
Writing objects: 100% (11/11), 20.86 KiB | 5.22 MiB/s, done.
Total 11 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), done.
To https://github.com/haffimt/Origo.Licensing.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'
```

### 2. Repository Verification
```powershell
gh repo view haffimt/Origo.Licensing
```
**Result**: Successfully opened the repository in browser, confirming all files were uploaded.

## Key Learning Points

### Authentication Hierarchy
1. **GitHub CLI Account**: Primary authentication method for GitHub operations
2. **Windows Credential Manager**: Secondary cache that can override CLI settings
3. **Git Config**: Local repository configuration (was correct in this case)

### Multiple Account Management
- Always check active account before GitHub operations: `gh auth status`
- Use account switching when needed: `gh auth switch --user <username>`
- Clear credential cache when switching: `cmdkey /delete:git:https://github.com`

### Repository Management
- Verify repository exists before pushing: `gh repo view <owner>/<repo>`
- Create repository if needed: `gh repo create <owner>/<repo> --public`
- Use GitHub CLI for consistency with authentication

## Prevention Strategies

### For Future Projects
1. **Pre-flight Checks**:
   ```powershell
   gh auth status                    # Verify correct account
   gh repo view <owner>/<repo>       # Verify repository exists
   git remote -v                     # Verify correct remote URL
   ```

2. **Account Management**:
   - Document which account should be used for each project
   - Set up account-specific SSH keys if using multiple accounts regularly
   - Use GitHub CLI for consistent authentication

3. **Credential Hygiene**:
   - Clear credential cache when switching between accounts
   - Use specific credential helpers for different accounts if needed
   - Regular cleanup of Windows Credential Manager entries

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose | Command |
|------|---------|---------|
| GitHub CLI | Account management, repository creation | `gh auth status`, `gh auth switch`, `gh repo create` |
| Windows Credential Manager | Credential cache cleanup | `cmdkey /delete:git:https://github.com` |
| Git | Repository operations | `git remote -v`, `git push -u origin main` |

## Timeline of Resolution

1. **Problem Identification**: Push failed with "repository not found"
2. **Initial Investigation**: Verified remote URL was correct
3. **Authentication Discovery**: Found wrong GitHub account was active
4. **Account Switch**: Changed to correct account using GitHub CLI
5. **Repository Creation**: Created missing repository
6. **Credential Cleanup**: Cleared cached credentials blocking authentication
7. **Successful Push**: Code successfully uploaded to GitHub
8. **Verification**: Confirmed repository accessible and complete
